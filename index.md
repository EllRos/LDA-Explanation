## Interpreting Blackbox Text Classifiers with LDA-Based Topic Models

Originaly done in [Oved, N., Feder, A. and Reichart, R. (2020)](https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/coli_a_00383) and later presented in [EMNLP 2020's blackbox workshop](https://blackboxnlp.github.io/), a method for interpreting blackbox text classifiers using an LDA model is implemented. While still using a "traditional" LDA model, the implementation offers tools for interpreting the model's predictions.
